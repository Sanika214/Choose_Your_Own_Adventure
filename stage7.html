<h1>Stage 7: The End</h1>
<p>
You return to your hometown as a hero, the case solved, and Chloe safely returned. The town celebrates your success, but it’s a bittersweet moment. You’re proud of finally solving the case, but as you reflect, a sense of unease lingers, there is still unfinished business, as the stalker is still out there. But before you can really think about in the moment, Chloe approaches you and says
“Thanks for saving me, but what about the stalker?”
