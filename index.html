    <h1>Welcome to Unsolved, a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Game!</h1>
<p>
  In Unsolved, every choice you make will impact the outcome of the story. As a detective tasked with uncovering the mystery of a missing high school student, Chloe Smith, you’ll need to gather clues, make tough decisions, and follow leads carefully to solve the case.
</p>
    <p>
  Throughout the game, you’ll be asked what you’d like to do next; each decision could move you forward or bring the investigation to an unexpected end.
</p>
    <p>
  Remember to type in your answer in ALL CAPS and to type “STOP” at any point to exit the game.
</p>
    <p>
Good luck, Detective, and remember: Chloe’s fate rests in your hands.
