<h1>Enter the cabin through the front door (It’s obviously the easiest thing to do)</h1>

  <p>
You slowly enter the dimly lit house and see a note on a table, “Look behind you”. All of a sudden the door slams shut behind you. You turn around to see an unfamiliar face. Oh no! You realize you walked straight into the kidnapper’s plan. He lunges at you, and easily overpowers you in the struggle. You barely escape his grasp and retreat. Unfortunately, you are unable to save Chloe. You head back to town in despair. GAME OVER!
