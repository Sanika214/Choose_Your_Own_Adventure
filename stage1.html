<h1>Stage 1: Explore the Forest Deeper</h1>
<p>
You are in Chloeâ€™s room, it is tidy with posters covering the walls and her schoolwork nearly stacked on her desk. However, something feels off. To get started, you need to choose your first step carefully.
</p>
<p>
  Do you...
</p>
  <!-- the list of different user options -->
<ul>
  <li>CHECK THE DESK (There might be notes or a journal with helpful information)</li>
  <li>LOOK UNDER THE BED (Things are often hidden where people don't expect)</li>
  <li>STOP (This case is tough. Maybe it's best to leave it to someone else.)</li>
</ul>  

  <p>
  Type your option below: (CHECK THE DESK, LOOK UNDER THE BED, STOP)
</p>
  
<input type="text" id="input" />
  <button onclick="submit()">submit</button>
</div>
  
<script>
function submit(){
  var option = document.getElementById("input").value;
  sessionStorage.setItem('option',option);
  //depending on user input sends them to the right option page
if (option == "CHECK THE DESK"){
  window.location.href = 'stage1option1.html';
}
else if (option == "LOOK UNDER THE BED"){
  window.location.href = 'stage1option2.html';
}
  else if (option == "STOP"){
  window.location.href = 'stage1option3.html';
}
  else {
